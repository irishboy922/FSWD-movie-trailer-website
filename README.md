# Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer (FSWD) Movie Trailer Website Project
---
## Project Description:
This project required us to write object-oriented Python server-side code to store a list of our favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. We then needed to use our code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse the movies and watch the trailers.

Modification I made to this project included site design modifications and the use of a 3rd Party API to get the information used for the movies.
